# Cloud-Hosting-Company
A mockup website for a Cloud Hosting Company, using Front-End Development tools and technologies. The whole website was designed using HTML, CSS and abit of JavaScript.

This is a practice project to enhance Front-End Development skills. The website was designed in a mobile-first approach. 
Components were built first and then once all compoenents were ready, they were combined with eachother.

The playground.html file was used for debugging styling errors in the main index.html file.
